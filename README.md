It showcases the basic use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to design and structure a functional website. The portfolio highlights personal information, skills, educational background, and sample works. It is designed to demonstrate an understanding of fundamental web development concepts such as page layout, navigation menus, linking pages, and basic styling.
